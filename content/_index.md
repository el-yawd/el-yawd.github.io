Internet is [broken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), but there are some places that still worth.

There are too much slop, distraction, and noise out there, this is a place where I stop all this for a while and share what I do and what I'm. This is my [candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World), and I hope it can help you find some break in the middle of all this. Enjoy it.
