## Motivation

I'm a very insecure guy.

In fact, that was first real feedback that I received from a manager (now a dear friend), "You're exceptionally good in your tasks, but damn, you're too insecure about yourself",
this trait got in my way in a various situations like defending a technical decision to other devs. This was last year, since it a lot of stuff happened:

I joined a [Bitcoin developer lauchpad](https://vinteum.org/bdl/) where I had the opportunity to meet extremely talented people; started to learn Rust and contribute to Open Source; got
the [second place](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-diego-reis_pt-br-nesse-final-de-semana-tive-a-honra-activity-7265462643681882142-uAii?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC9RzZoBOaiAkuUzfJqU3xD7yaNnRvr4aek)
in a [hackathon](https://eventos.institutoasw.org/); did a [talk](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-diego-reis_this-weekend-ive-gave-a-talk-at-h2hc-activity-7275507219964534784-SUWu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC9RzZoBOaiAkuUzfJqU3xD7yaNnRvr4aek) in the greatest cybersecurity event of Latin America; started to do english classes with an amazing [teacher](https://x.com/umTeacher01), and, started to work at [Turso](https://turso.tech/) as Open Source contributor in project [Limbo](https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo/).

It's been almost 4 months since I started to work there, and honestly, I've never felt so down in my professional life, which is funny, it's by far the best team I've ever worked with, awesome project, tons of new stuff to learn everyday and yet, I thought that I didn't deserve it. And this feeling has been hauting me since day one, but it was getting worse, specially now that I'm tackling harder problems.

Until now, feeling insecure or just dumb have never messed up with my personal/academic life but this time is different, I've been anxious, distracted, umotivated or just avoiding things that would be good for
me and it's awful. But two things that just happened made me want to fight against this:

- My uncle invited me to do an interview on his twitch channel to chat about Limbo;
- My submission to do a talk on [gambiConf](https://gambiconf.dev/) was accepted ðŸŽ‰

The latter was specially important for me because last year I submitted a talk (the one that I did on H2HC) and it was reject, but at least I got two free tickets. I went to the event with my wife and we saw all
that nice people talking about things they care and did, they were cool. And now I'll be there too! I just can't continue to live like I've been living, losing the momentum of this fantastic phase of my life.

## The Bet

Here is the deal, during a month I'll:

- Stop using social media (specially X, I don't need to "monitor the situation" every hour).
- Do ~at least~ two blog posts.
- Work and study as I've never did before.

What I'm beting? Anything. If you see this just reach me out and give your terms, I'll accept it.

## Why I'm doing a blog post for that?

Humans are social beings, and as such, public contracts and actions can be a greater motivator and impose some ~hopefully good~ preasure. I'm beting on that pression, that's the reason I'm doing this publicly.


>[!NOTE] Just for the record, this blog post doesn't count on my bet, so that's not the reason ;)
